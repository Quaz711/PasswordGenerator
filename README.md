## Viewed the source code; Started implementing functionality

* Upon first look of the javascript code there were no functions to generate a random password. I created several functions to process inputs that may be available for change and updating futuristically as well.

## Error detection; Making sure code would not crash

* I implemented several error checking spots to make sure the code would not crash and caring through with its purpose.
